# Peer learning and values

It may seem impractical to discuss values during a training session -- after all, you are already here, which means you are probably on board with the library’s values. 

However, it is worth taking some time to discuss the values that were behind the creation of this training to see how they compare with your own values and your goals for encouraging adult learning.

Begin by looking at Peer to Peer University’s Values and Vision.

Now discuss:
- In the group, make a list of opportunities that exist for adult learning -- coding boot camps, DIY schools, online classes, arts organization classes, community college, etc. Give each example a grade for how well they meet the goals of peer learning, community, and equity.
- Can these values ever conflict with one another?
- As a group -- get this list of eight values down to three:
   - Learning should be:
      - Social
      - Free
      - Based on the highest quality resources
      - Thorough
      - Culturally relevant
      - Verifiable by an employer
      - Interest-based
      - In-person
   - How did you decide which to choose? What compromises were you willing to make?


Here is a little background about the origin of this training and approach to organizing adult learning in libraries.

How are those goals similar to yours? How are they different?
