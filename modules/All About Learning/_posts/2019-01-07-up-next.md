# Up Next

By now, everyone in the group should:
- Understand the facilitator position description and the values behind peer learning
- Know some practical things that can make for good adult learning experiences
- Understand the values of peer learning, and apply them to personal motivations to participate in adult learning
- See the library as an important resource in the learning lives of adults in the community.

Next week, you will take a closer look at how facilitation works, and get some hands-on practice.
