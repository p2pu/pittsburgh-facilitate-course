# Reflection: Meaningful learning experience 

For this next discussion, assign a note-taker, who will write down the big ideas that come up during the conversation using a flip chart, white board, and a piece of paper. 

Each member of the group should take a few minutes to think about each of these questions. Take turns responding to each of them, allowing time for everyone to ask questions and discuss what comes up.

Reflecting on this discussion, note anything about peopleâ€™s motivations and values; the role of peers, mentors, and teachers; and any specific details about what worked well for people. As a facilitator, you should keep these in mind, because they are likely to be elements that will help other people, as well.
Up next: a deeper look at the values that are central to peer learning.
