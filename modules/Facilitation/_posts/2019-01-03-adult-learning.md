# Adult Learning

There are no education requirements for facilitating adult learning, and the skills needed to be a good facilitator are mostly interpersonal skills that anyone can develop with a little practice.

However, it can be helpful to spend a bit of time thinking about some of the unique characteristics of adult learning. Almost everyone has spent much more time in formal learning environments (school) designed to address youth learning needs. Do adults learn differently from children?

For this discussion, we will watch a brief video that explains one theory of adult learning called Andragogy. The purpose of this discussion is not to memorize facts about Andragogy, nor is it to endorse this theory of learning over others. As you watch the video, ask yourself if what they say rings true based on your own experience as an adult learner.

For each principle, solicit thoughts from the group. How might each principle appear in real life? Did any of these make you think of any experience from your life?

Use this discussion to deepen your understanding of what adult learning in the library should be like. As a facilitator, think about what you can do to create the conditions that encourage learning.
