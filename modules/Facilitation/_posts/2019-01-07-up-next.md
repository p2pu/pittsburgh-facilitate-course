# Up Next

By now, everyone in the group should:
- Have a basic understanding of some of the big concepts related to how adults learn.
- Know some techniques for facilitating group learning.
- Have more confidence (through practice) about your ability to facilitate learning.
- Be more aware of what learning sessions will be like.

Next week, you will take a closer look at some of the practical considerations to put all of these skills into action.
