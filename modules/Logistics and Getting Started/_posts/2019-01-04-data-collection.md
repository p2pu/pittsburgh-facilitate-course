# Data Collection

Feedback is an important part of peer learning, and it happens at a couple of levels. Facilitators can use input from learners to help them adjust the pace or content of a workshop; the library can use data about overall learning outcomes to allocate resources.

This guide recommends using these two simple tools to get feedback, in addition, of course, to talkback boards that provide community input on the topics of peer learning:
- The P2PU platform uses a built-in feedback tool that gets input from learners about about their goals and experiences. Encourage facilitators to set aside time in learning sessions to allow people to fill this out. 
- The Project Outcomes Education and Lifelong Learning provides consistent, tested, and brief survey questions to measure learning outcomes. Require facilitators to give this survey during the final session of a workshop.

Your facilitator can tell you about the measurements that you will use for your peer-learning workshops. Discuss the following:
- What surveys or other measurements will facilitators use for peer learning groups?
- Who is responsible for collecting data?
- How will facilitators have access to data about the groups that they facilitate?

Up next: Time to cover the basic information needed for your first workshop in the library.
