# Next Steps

Congratulations -- you are a trained peer learning facilitator.

At this point, everyone should:
- Understand what your role and the role of library staff
- Feel more confident about your first day facilitating
- Know how to use (and help others use) P2PU.org to register for an adult learning workshop
- Be aware of how the library measures success
The last step of this course, if you havenâ€™t done it yet, is to create an account and join a global community of peer learning enthusiasts over at [community.p2pu.org](https://community.p2pu.org). Take a few minutes now to sign up and introduce yourself on the discussion forum.
Before you adjourn, your facilitator will tell you the next steps in getting started with peer learning at the library.
