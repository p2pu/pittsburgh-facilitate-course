# Logistics of Volunteering

You have now covered the major points of facilitation, and it is time to get down to details -- what exactly is expected of you as a facilitator, and what you can expect your hosts at the library to do.

These details will vary from library to library; this guide does include a sample [Roles and Responsibilities documen](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H055JuYXuVNESYWPToJNU2-njVcwXqBr/edit#)t, but the facilitator of this training will provide the details for your learning groups.

Review the Roles and Responsibilities document.
- Does everyone clearly understand the role of the facilitator at the library?
- Do you know who to contact with questions, concerns, if you need supplies, or if you have a scheduling issue?
- Does anyone foresee any problem meeting these responsibilities?

Now that everyone has a clear understanding of what they will be doing, and can expect to be done for them, take a moment to cover those all-important day-to-day details:
- Clearances/Paperwork
- Travel and parking
- Logging volunteer hours

This is an important moment -- the end of the training. The facilitator will tell you next steps at the very end of the session, but take a minute to check-in now.
- Do you understand what you will be doing?
- Do you have any questions or reservations?
